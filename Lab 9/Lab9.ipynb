        "It produces the following reslts :\n",
        "- 0: Alice(0), her(10), she(26), her(32), Alice(59) - Again here we have the same result as in experimental example. As we said previously this cluster accurately captures all references to Alice, ensuring that \"her\" and \"she\" are correctly linked back to her.\n",
        "- 1: bank(14), it(45) - \"bank\" is the location where Alice is sitting, while \"it\" refers back to \"the bank\" . According to this example \"it had no pictures or conversations in it\" is talking about the bank, although in the sentence, \"it\" more logically refers to \"the book.\" There's a possible ambiguity here. In the sentence, \"it\" most logically refers to \"the book\" , not \"the bank.\" However, spaCy's model has linked \"it\" at position 45 to \"bank,\" which may be a misinterpretation based on sentence structure.\n",
        "- 2: book(31), it(38) - The pronoun \"it\" at position 38 correctly refers to \"the book\", but as we mentioned above we also think that \"it\" in position 45 referes to book .\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, in contrst with the first example we are missing the cluster for \"her sister\". However, since \"her sister\" is mentioned without pronouns referring back to her, this absence is understandable. Coreference resolution typically links pronouns to their antecedents, and repeated noun phrases without pronouns may not always form distinct clusters.\n",
